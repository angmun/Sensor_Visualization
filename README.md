# **Sensor Visualization**

In collaboration with Guinevere Gilman and Matthijs van Mierlo, we created an application that allows users to use light sensor input, gyroscope sensor input and audio input to draw on a canvas. Light sensor input corresponds to the opacity of the draw stroke. Gyroscope sensor input controls the draw stroke position on the canvas. Audio input controls the draw stroke\'s color and width. 
The user has the option to allow special modes to draw patterns for them rather than using the gyroscope. Draw stroke width and opacity can also be fixed.
One may save their creation on their device alone or upload it to the community gallery. From this gallery, community creations can be viewed and selected for 'remixing'.
Have a go at Synesthesia and behold the beauty of data!
